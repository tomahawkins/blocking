# Judicial Blocking Strategy, Tactics, and Analysis

If a team selectively blocks only in situtations that have a higher than normal
outcome for sucess, i.e. scoring a point from the block,
how would this alter a team's overall performance?

What situations would meet the condition of "higher than normal" and what is the threshold?

Volleyball Rule Changes and the Bifurcation of Optimal Defensive Strategy

  A Possible Unexploited Shift from Blocking to Digging?


Blocking has a lot of negative outcomes, some are unperceived by fans:
- A block that contacts the ball can lead to:
  - point losses due to unrecoverable touches or deflections,
  - uncontrollable play forcing a free ball back to the attacking team,
  - a block that the opposing team can recover and reattack,
- Point losses due to net violation by blockers.
- A block can give additional options to the offense, e.g. getting tooled.
- Attackers coming off a block are less effective than ones that are alreday in position for an attack.
- Blocking presents a injury risk of finger jams and rolled ankles.

Rule changes (circa 2000) gave significant advantage to digging:
- First 2-hit overhand pass on hard driven ball.
- Then 2-hit on first team contact.
- Libero.

Open questions:
- Did these rule changes affect the optimal defensive strategy beyond digging?
- With better digging, is blocking less advantageous?
- How does the optimal blocking strategy vary over the spectrum of play?
- What is the optimal blocking strategy at womens division II?
- Is it possible the current blocking strategy is significantly overvalued?
  - Can this be exploited?
  - How can we test if this is the case?

# Judicial Blocking Tactics

- No blocks for backrow attacks.
- No blocks for off-hits, i.e. missed sets, missed approaches.
- Limit one blocker in the middle.  OHs cover deflections and dumps.
- Limit one blocker on the outside.  MB covers deflections and dumps.
- Issue single blockers only when there is high likelyhood of success, i.e. when ball is set tight.
- Dispatch limited blockers on a bad pass.
  - If set if behind 10-foot line, chances are it can only go effectly to the outside (left or right
    depending on the set location).  Therefore only put 1 blocker on the outside, and
    have the other two players drop back to get ready for the attack.
- Randomize any of the above.
- The upper bound strategy: Don't block.

Advantages of a reduced blocking defense:
- Adds more defenders to dig.  Lowers floor area for each defender to cover.
- Blockers don't have time to correct after the ball is hit.  Floor defenders do.
- Floor defenders can line up a hit with good accuracy, usually even shortly after the ball leaves the setter's hands.
  But a touched block introduces a high degree of uncertainty that floor defense can not easily correct for.
- In division 2, off-hits and backrow attacks have about the same level of energy as a strong jump serve,
  which floor defense already has a proven track record of quality recoveries.
- Lowers effectiveness of offensives hitting strategies, since most hitting strategies are
  aimed an undermining blocker, not floor defense.  Setting dumps in particular.








In the late 90s, volleyball's governing body clarified the rules 
regarding double contact on hard driven balls allowing receiving
both serves and attacks with -- what at the time was called sloppy -- overhand passing.
Then in 2000 the rules
were further relaxed allowing double hits on any team first contact.
Also, in 1998 the Libero defensive specialist position was introduced.
All these rule changes gave significant advanage to the floor defense (digging).
And yet apart from using the direct application of these new rules, little 
has changed in the overall defensive strategy of the game.
Are the conventional strategies currently employeed really the optimal ones
or did the new rules cause a bifurcation that
significantly altered the optimal defensive strategy, and in which somehow 
the volleyball community has missed?

In dynamical systems, bifurcation is a property where a system's dynamic
topology changes significantly with minor variations in the parameters
that define the system.  For example, an aircraft will go unstable 
when its center of mass is shifted too far aft; the center of mass being
a parametric value.
Though I haven't seen it mentioned in liturature as such, bifurcations
can also be applied to game theory to describe how optimal strategies can
radically change "topology" given subtle variations in a game's rules (parameters).

Spectrum of level of play, kids in elementary school to mens international.
How does the optimal blocking strategy change across this spectrum?





- Eliminates touch-out-of-bounds point losses.
  - Eliminates wiping hitting strategy and blockers getting tooled.
- Eliminates returning the ball by a block for the opponents to attack again.
- Faster transition to offense.
- Lowers effectiveness of offensives hitting strategies.
  - Nearly all hitting strategies are aimed an undermining blocker, not floor defense.
    - 1s, 31s, slides, cross, shoot, dumps are all designed to catch blockers off guard.
  - In particular, setting dumps are effective because the go over unsuspecting blockers
    and into the doughnut.  But if the blockers are off the net in floor defense,
    dumps will be less effective.
- Lowers net incursions.  Blockers have high percentage of net violations.
- Safety and improved team health.
  - Ankle rolls and finger jams are are primarily caused by blocking.
- Leniency of 2-hit rules.  First on hard driven balls, now on first team contact.
    - Gives significant advantage to digging defense.


Disadvantages of not blocking:

- Hitters attack unopposed at the net.
- Setters can intentionally set tight for hitters to hit straight down.
- Loss of the four hit advantage.
  - Loss of the ability for the block to absorb energy.


Open Questions:

- Do the pros outweigh the cons?
- If this is true, has this always been the case or did it change with "minor" shifts in rules, i.e. 2-hit rules.
- At what point in the spectrum of play (elementary school to olympic level) does blocking become important?
- Is the optimal defense a mixed strategy?
  - Single blockers randomly issued and only when the ball is tight.
- What is the best offense to counter a non or minimal blocking defense?
- If deploying a minimal blocking defense, what is the best way to mask it?
  - Three blockers with hands up at every serve.
- What is the best way to validate/invalidate this theory when the only
  datasets are played with conventional strategies?
- This analysis is based on the assumption that attacking is an advantage
  and that future events in a volley are irrelevant.  Is this valid?
  - What happens when the "advantage" of blocking exceeds 50%?
    Does this imply attacking is no longer an advantage?

Other analysis:

- Geometry of hitting ball and court to determine optimal placement of floor defense.
  - Most hits land behind 5 meters from attacker.  Measure this statistic in real games.
    - Some players can hit closer, aka "straight down", but this is uncommon in games.
- How accurate is setting based on distance from net?
  - Can a setter consistently put it close to the net in real games?
- Pie slice vs. reaction time:
  - Up close a blockers hand covers a lot of area, but they can't react after the ball is hit.
  - A floor defender covers less area, but they have much more time to react.
- What is the correlation between number of attacks in a volley and winning a volley?
