A Blocking Strategy for Volleyball: Don't


Is blocking more of a risk than an advantage?


Possible advantages to not blocking:

- Adds 2 to 3 more defenders to dig.  Lowers floor area for each defender to cover.
- Blockers don't have time to correct after the ball is hit.  Floor defenders do.
- Floor defenders can line up a hit, but have a hard time adjusting a hit deflected by a block.
- Eliminates touch-out-of-bounds point losses.
  - Eliminates wiping hitting strategy and blockers getting "used".
- Lowers effectiveness of offensives hitting strategies.
  - Nearly all hitting strategies are aimed an undermining blocker, not floor defense.
    - 1s, 31s, slides, cross, shoot, dumps are all designed to catch blockers off guard.
  - In particular, setting dumps are effective because the go over unsuspecting blockers
    and into the doughnut.  But if the blockers are off the net in floor defense,
    dumps will be less effective.
- Lowers net incursions.  Blockers have high percentage of net violations.
- Leniency of 2-hit rules.  First on hard driven balls, now on first team contact.
    - Gives significant advantage to digging defense.
- A touched block takes away advantage of 2-hit first contact.  (Is a block a "first team contact"?)
- Safety and improved team health.
  - Ankle rolls and finger jams are are primarily caused by blocking.


Disadvantages of not blocking:

- Hitters can attack unopposed at the net.
- Setters can intentionally set tight for hitters to hit straight down.
- Loss of the four hit advantage.
  - Loss of the ability for the block to absorb energy.


Open Questions:

- Do the pros outweigh the cons?
- If this is true, has this always been the case or did it change with "minor" shifts in rules, i.e. 2-hit rules.
- At what point in the spectrum of play (elementary school to olympic level) does blocking become important?
- Is the optimal defense a mixed strategy?
  - Single blockers randomly issued and only when the ball is tight.
- What is the best offense to counter a non or minimal blocking defense?
- If deploying a minimal blocking defense, what is the best way to mask it?
  - Three blockers with hands up at every serve.
- What is the best way to validate/invalidate this theory when the only
  datasets are played with conventional strategies?
- This analysis is based on the assumption that attacking is an advantage
  and that future events in a volley are irrelevent.  Is this valid?

Other analysis:

- Geometry of hitting ball and court to determine optimal placement of floor defense.
  - Most hits land behind 5 meters from attacker.  Measure this statistic in real games.
    - Some players can hit closer, aka "straight down", but this is uncommon in games.
- How accurate is setting based on distance from net?
  - Can a setter consistantly put it close to the net in real games?
- Pie slice vs. reaction time:
  - Up close a blockers hand covers a lot of area, but they can't react after the ball is hit.
  - A floor defender covers less area, but they have much more time to react.

Generalizing the Problem:  Finding and Exploiting Flaws in Conventional Wisdom

- Conventional Wisdom hold inertia.  It's slow to change over time.
- Seemingly small changes in environment (e.g. rule changes) can lead to large changes
  in optimal strategies.  This can produce flaws in conventional wisdom.
- How do you identify conventional wisdom in different domains?
- How do you identify the changes that may invalidate conventional wisdom.


Other Alternative Strategies

- Early analysis showed touched blocks failed more than non-touched blocks.
  - Should hitters target blockers more that the open court?
  - What is the most effective hit to exploit blockers?
    - Blockers can only direct a block down if their hands are angled, i.e. penetrating the net.
- Attack in 2.
  - How effective are setter dumps and attacks on the 2nd touch?
  - How well could an offense apply attack-in-2?
