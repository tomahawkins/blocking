A Blocking Strategy for Volleyball: Don't

  Is blocking more of a risk than an advantage?


Possible advantages to not blocking:

- Adds two more defenders to dig.  Lowers floor area for each defender to cover.
- Blockers don't have time to correct after the ball is hit.  Floor defenders do.
- Lowers effectiveness of offensives hitting strategies.
  - Nearly all hitting strategies are aimed an undermining blocker, not digging defense.
    - 1s, 31s, slides, cross, shoot, dumps are all designed to catch blockers off guard.
- Removes touch-out-of-bounds point losses.
- Removes wiping hitting strategy, i.e. blockers getting "used".
- Lowers net incursions.  Blockers have high percentage of net violations.
- Leniency of 2-hit rules.  First on hard driven balls, now on first team contact.
    - Gives significant advantage to digging defense.
- Safety.
  - Ankle rolls are primarily caused by blockers colliding.
  - Most finger jams are from blocking.


Clear disadvantages of not blocking:

- Hitters can attack unopposed at the net.
- Setters can intentionally set tight for hitters to hit straight down.
- Loss of the four hit advantage.
- Loss of the ability for the block to absorb energy.


Open Questions:

- Do the pros outweigh the cons?
- If this is true, has this always been the case or did it change with "minor" shifts in rules, i.e. 2-hit rules.
- Does this strategy hold of in different divisions?
  - Mens' leagues:  Is hitting too strong not to block?
- Is the optimal defense a mixed strategy?
  - Single blockers randomly issued and only when the ball is tight.


Generalizing the Problem:  Finding and Exploiting Flaws in Conventional Wisdom

- Conventional Wisdom hold inertia.  It's slow to change over time.
- Seemingly small changes in environment (e.g. rule changes) can lead to large changes
  in optimal strategies.  This can produce flaws in conventional wisdom.
- How do you identify conventional wisdom in different domains?
- How do you identify the changes that may invalidate conventional wisdom.
