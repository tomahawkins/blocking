Volleyball Rule Changes and the Bifurcation of Defensive Strategy

In the late 90s, volleyball's governing body clarified the rules 
regarding double contact on hard driven balls allowing receiving
both serves and attacks with -- what at the time was called sloppy -- overhand passing.
Then in 2000 the rules
were further relaxed allowing double hits on any team first contact.
Also, in 1998 the Libero defensive specialist position was introduced.
All these rule changes gave significant advanage to the floor defense (digging).
And yet apart from using the direct application of these new rules, little 
has changed in the overall defensive strategy of the game.
Are the conventional strategies currently employeed really the optimal ones
or did these rule changes cause a bifurcation that
significantly altered the optimal defensive strategy of the game, and in which somehow 
the volleyball community has missed?

In dynamical systems, bifurcation is a property where a system's dynamic
topology changes significantly with minor variations in the parameters
that define the system.  For example, an aircraft will go unstable 
when its center of mass is shifted too far aft.
Though I haven't seen it mentioned in liturature as such, but bifurcation
can also be applied to game theory to describe how optimal strategies can significantly
change "topology" given subtle variations in the rules (parameters).



A Blocking Strategy for Volleyball: Don't

Does blocking present more of a risk than an advantage?
Does blocking warrant 50% of the defensive team?


Possible advantages to not blocking:

- Adds 2 to 3 more defenders to dig.  Lowers floor area for each defender to cover.
- Blockers don't have time to correct after the ball is hit.  Floor defenders do.
- Floor defenders can line up a hit, but have a hard time adjusting to a hit deflected by a block.
- Eliminates touch-out-of-bounds point losses.
  - Eliminates wiping hitting strategy and blockers getting "used".
- Eliminates returning the ball by a block for the opponents to attack again.
- Lowers effectiveness of offensives hitting strategies.
  - Nearly all hitting strategies are aimed an undermining blocker, not floor defense.
    - 1s, 31s, slides, cross, shoot, dumps are all designed to catch blockers off guard.
  - In particular, setting dumps are effective because the go over unsuspecting blockers
    and into the doughnut.  But if the blockers are off the net in floor defense,
    dumps will be less effective.
- Lowers net incursions.  Blockers have high percentage of net violations.
- Safety and improved team health.
  - Ankle rolls and finger jams are are primarily caused by blocking.
- Leniency of 2-hit rules.  First on hard driven balls, now on first team contact.
    - Gives significant advantage to digging defense.


Disadvantages of not blocking:

- Hitters attack unopposed at the net.
- Setters can intentionally set tight for hitters to hit straight down.
- Loss of the four hit advantage.
  - Loss of the ability for the block to absorb energy.


Open Questions:

- Do the pros outweigh the cons?
- If this is true, has this always been the case or did it change with "minor" shifts in rules, i.e. 2-hit rules.
- At what point in the spectrum of play (elementary school to olympic level) does blocking become important?
- Is the optimal defense a mixed strategy?
  - Single blockers randomly issued and only when the ball is tight.
- What is the best offense to counter a non or minimal blocking defense?
- If deploying a minimal blocking defense, what is the best way to mask it?
  - Three blockers with hands up at every serve.
- What is the best way to validate/invalidate this theory when the only
  datasets are played with conventional strategies?
- This analysis is based on the assumption that attacking is an advantage
  and that future events in a volley are irrelevant.  Is this valid?
  - What happens when the "advantage" of blocking exceeds 50%?
    Does this imply attacking is no longer an advantage?

Other analysis:

- Geometry of hitting ball and court to determine optimal placement of floor defense.
  - Most hits land behind 5 meters from attacker.  Measure this statistic in real games.
    - Some players can hit closer, aka "straight down", but this is uncommon in games.
- How accurate is setting based on distance from net?
  - Can a setter consistently put it close to the net in real games?
- Pie slice vs. reaction time:
  - Up close a blockers hand covers a lot of area, but they can't react after the ball is hit.
  - A floor defender covers less area, but they have much more time to react.
- What is the correlation between number of attacks in a volley and winning a volley?

Other Alternative Strategies

- Early analysis showed touched blocks failed more than non-touched blocks.
  - Should hitters target blockers more that the open court?
  - What is the most effective hit to exploit blockers?
    - Blockers can only direct a block down if their hands are angled, i.e. penetrating the net.
- Attack in 2.
  - How effective are setter dumps and attacks on the 2nd touch?
  - How well could an offense apply attack-in-2?
