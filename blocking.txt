A Blocking Strategy for Volleyball: Don't

  Is blocking more of a risk than an advantage?


Possible advantages to not blocking:

- Adds 2 to 3 more defenders to dig.  Lowers floor area for each defender to cover.
- Blockers don't have time to correct after the ball is hit.  Floor defenders do.
- Floor defenders can line up a hit, but have a hard time adjusting a hit deflected by a block.
- Lowers effectiveness of offensives hitting strategies.
  - Nearly all hitting strategies are aimed an undermining blocker, not digging defense.
    - 1s, 31s, slides, cross, shoot, dumps are all designed to catch blockers off guard.
  - In particular, setting dumps are effective because the go over the blockers at the
    net and into the doughnut.  But if the blockers are off the net in floor defense,
    dump will come directly at them.
- Removes touch-out-of-bounds point losses.
- Removes wiping hitting strategy, i.e. blockers getting "used".
- Lowers net incursions.  Blockers have high percentage of net violations.
- Leniency of 2-hit rules.  First on hard driven balls, now on first team contact.
    - Gives significant advantage to digging defense.
- A touched block takes away 2-hit first contact advantage (Is this true by the rules?).
- Safety.
  - Ankle rolls are primarily caused by blockers colliding.
  - Most finger jams are from blocking.


Disadvantages of not blocking:

- Hitters can attack unopposed at the net.
- Setters can intentionally set tight for hitters to hit straight down.
- Loss of the four hit advantage.
- Loss of the ability for the block to absorb energy.


Open Questions:

- Do the pros outweigh the cons?
- If this is true, has this always been the case or did it change with "minor" shifts in rules, i.e. 2-hit rules.
- At what point in the spectrum of play (elementary to Olympic mens) does blocking become important?
- Is the optimal defense a mixed strategy?
  - Single blockers randomly issued and only when the ball is tight.
- What is the best offense to a non or minimal blocking defense?
- What is the best way to prove/disprove this theory when the only
  datasets are played with conventional strategies?
- If deploying a minimal blocking defense, what is the best way to mask it?
  - Three blockers with hands up at every serve.

Generalizing the Problem:  Finding and Exploiting Flaws in Conventional Wisdom

- Conventional Wisdom hold inertia.  It's slow to change over time.
- Seemingly small changes in environment (e.g. rule changes) can lead to large changes
  in optimal strategies.  This can produce flaws in conventional wisdom.
- How do you identify conventional wisdom in different domains?
- How do you identify the changes that may invalidate conventional wisdom.


Other Alternative Strategies

- Early analysis should touched blocks failed more than non-touched blocks.
  - Have hitters target blockers directly.
- Attack in 2.
  - Setter dumps are very effective.



The Mental Game:  Psychology

The difference between a good day and a bad day is far greater than
improvement gained by a year's worth of training.

Performing well and performing badly are not random events.  They always come in sets.

How can we maximize psychological effectiveness?
How can we increase the likelihood that we feel good and our game is on when it is time to play?

- Cheering each other on, group huddles, etc.
  - But can overdoing it be a detriment?
- Caffeine.  A cup of chai right before the game.

How does the emotional rollercoaster work?  What are the cycles of ups and downs?
- Probably not possible to maintain an up for an entire match/tournament.
- Can we control ups and downs?
  - Ensure we trade points on a lull (but not lose a run).
  - Induce an up only at the right times when it is critical.
- Does a down increase the likelihood of a future up?

What is the best way to lose a match?  If you know you are going to lose
a set, is there anything you can do in the loss to increase the likelihood of a 
win in the next set?
- Does a late game rally by the starters do anything to help next game, or does it hurt?
  - An up and then a down followed by a break between sets.
  - Would it be better to sub in the second string and give the first string
    a longer break and let the second string absorb the loss?

Maximize comfort, minimize irritants.
- Spandex shorts.
  - They're always riding up, players are always pulling them down.
  - Do they really help defense and rolling digs?
  - A barrier to entry:
    - How many talented girls did not get into volleyball because
      the shorts made them feel uncomfortable?
    - Volleyball doesn't take years of practice to get good.  Case in point: Dane Hansen
      - How many Clarion basketball players could become great volleyball players,
        but won't because of the shorts?
